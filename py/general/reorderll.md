1. **Helper Function `reverse_list`**:
   ```python
   def reverse_list(node):
       prev = None
       current = node
       while current:
           next_node = current.next
           current.next = prev
           prev = current
           current = next_node
       return prev
   ```
   - This function takes a linked list `node` and reverses it. It uses the classic iterative approach to reverse a linked list.

2. **Main Function `reorderList`**:
   ```python
   def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
       if not head or not head.next:
           return
   ```
   - This method takes the head of a singly-linked list as input and checks if the list is empty or has only one element. If so, there's no need to reorder, and the method returns.

   ```python
       # Find the middle of the linked list
       slow = head
       fast = head
       while fast and fast.next:
           slow = slow.next
           fast = fast.next.next
   ```
   - It then uses the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.

   ```python
       # Reverse the second half of the linked list
       reversed_half = reverse_list(slow)
   ```
   - The method calls the `reverse_list` helper function to reverse the second half of the linked list, starting from the middle.

   ```python
       # Merge the two halves
       first_half = head
       second_half = reversed_half
       while second_half:
           temp1 = first_half.next
           temp2 = second_half.next
           first_half.next = second_half
           second_half.next = temp1
           first_half = temp1
           second_half = temp2
   ```
   - It then merges the two halves of the linked list. It alternates between nodes from the first half and nodes from the reversed second half.

   ```python
       # Set the last node's next to None to avoid cycles
       if first_half:
           first_half.next = None
   ```
   - Finally, it checks if there is a remaining node in the first half (in case the length is odd) and sets its `next` to `None` to avoid creating cycles in the reordered list.

The overall effect is that the linked list is reordered by taking nodes from the first half and nodes from the reversed second half alternately.
